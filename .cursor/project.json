    "description": "This project explores language-driven multi-robot coordination for navigation and obstacle avoidance in the MuJoCo simulation environment. It extends the Robot-Collab framework to enable two ground robots to interpret high-level natural language instructions and translate them into structured subgoals.",
    "repo": "https://github.com/huiwenxue122/co-robot-pathfinding.git",
    "goals": [
      "Build a 2D MuJoCo environment with obstacles and target zones.",
      "Integrate two mobile robots for independent and cooperative navigation.",
      "Connect to an LLM API for natural language task decomposition.",
      "Implement inter-robot collision avoidance and coordination logic.",
      "Visualize trajectories and performance metrics using matplotlib."
